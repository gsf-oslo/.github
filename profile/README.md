## Introduction

Green Software - Oslo is a non-profit meetup group located in Oslo, Norway. The group operates under Green Software Foundation (GSF) umbrella.

**The group's mission** is to provide an arena where local community can gather on a regular basis to share knowledge and experiences around green software and cloud native sustainability, inspire each other and learn from each other.

Our group is diverse and inclusive and we welcome talks from anyone as long as the topics are in scope for the green tech domain. **We don't accept sales pitches and product marketing focused types of talks.**

The Green Software Foundation is a non-profit with the mission to create a trusted ecosystem of people, standards, tooling and best practices for green software. 
The Green Software Foundation aims to change the culture of building software across the tech industry, so sustainability becomes a core priority to software teams, just as important as performance, security, cost and accessibility.
The Foundation's mission is to reduce the total change in global carbon emissions associated with software. Ensuring that all of our members and contributors feel that they can actively contribute will ensure that we create an environment that promotes belonging and will lead to better outcomes.
